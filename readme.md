# Advent of Code 2021
This is my answers to [advent of code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

**SPOILER WARNING:** If you're trying to solve the puzzles yourself, I strongly advice against looking at the files in this repository. You have been warned.

This year I am writing the puzzles in PHP, mainly because I didn't figure out what other language to use. I am familiar with the language, and have worked extensively with it before, so it will give me a baseline of understanding going forward. Hopefully that means I will be able to finish more days than I did last year.

I know I haven't created this repository immediately, but I am creating it now... I was being lazy and just stored the code locally.

If you want to run my code, you will need PHP installed. All scripts have been tested in PHP 7.4, so I only guarantee that it will work with that version.

To run the code simply run:
```
php DAY/task.php
```

This will run the input from `input.txt`. If you want to run the example from `example.txt` simply append `example` as an argument to the command:
```
php DAY/task.php example
```

Please note that the task is only executable from the command line.

This year I have simplified it by making one file for both tasks, which will run at the same time.

Some scripts might need to be optimalized if I've been in a rush. If they do, I will add a todo comment to said package, and some readme information to let you know that I will be working on optimalizing the code when I have the time.

Please note that inputs may need to be changed based on your user account.

I will try to install as few external packages as possible, and if I will need someone, I will probably use composer. So far I haven't had the need to do so, but I will update this readme if there is any necessary packages to download.
